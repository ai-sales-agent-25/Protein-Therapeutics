| What’s useful for your Pareto-FM SaaS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Why it only lands mid-scale                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Discrete-token generator in a biology setting.** The model diffuses 402-nt DNA sequences and shows how conditioning tricks (frequency blending, donor/acceptor priors) make *token-space* diffusion viable for real genomics tasks—evidence that the wet-lab market values sequence-only generators.  | **Diffusion, not Flow-Matching.** You still need your faster (<15-step) FM objective and straight-path shortcuts to hit SaaS latency and compute KPIs.                                                                |
| **On-the-fly guidance concept.** Blending empirical nucleotide frequencies into the reverse process is a lightweight way to inject hard biological priors without retraining—a pattern you could copy for “toxicity veto” or “immunogenicity prior” terms in your Pareto layer.                         | **Single-objective focus.** The model optimises splice-site realism alone; no weight-vector conditioning, dominance classification, or Pareto-front steering. Your multi-objective slider remains the differentiator. |
| **Cheap surrogate evaluation illustrated.** They validate synthetics with splice-site classifiers instead of wet-lab assays—mirrors how your platform will call in-silico scorers (e.g., AlphaFold, immuno-predictors) to save budget.                                                                  | **Domain and length mismatch.** Targets short intron–exon windows, not full proteins/peptides; protein-specific objectives (affinity, stability) and GxP compliance are outside its scope.                            |

**Take-away**

The paper is a **helpful technical cousin**—its frequency-blending trick could inspire lightweight prior injection in your FM sampler—but because it uses diffusion, tackles only one biological constraint, and operates on DNA rather than protein sequences, it supports rather than advances the core value-prop of a Pareto-aware Flow-Matching SaaS.
