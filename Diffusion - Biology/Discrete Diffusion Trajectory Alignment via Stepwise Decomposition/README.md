**Paper:** Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition

### 1. Summary and Rating

**Summary:** This paper introduces Stepwise Decomposition Preference Optimization (SDPO), a novel method for aligning pre-trained discrete diffusion models with arbitrary reward functions. Standard alignment techniques like RL are challenging for diffusion models due to the multi-step, discrete sampling process. SDPO tackles this by decomposing the complex problem of aligning the entire generation trajectory into a series of simpler, per-timestep subproblems. Each subproblem aims to align the model's posterior distribution `p(x_0|x_t)` (predicting the clean data from a noisy state) with the reward function. The authors prove that, under an additive reward factorization, optimally solving these stepwise objectives is equivalent to solving the original trajectory alignment problem. They derive a general and tractable loss function based on distribution matching that works for arbitrary rewards, generalizing beyond the pairwise preference setting of DPO. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated with significant performance gains over strong RL-based baselines on tasks including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and large-scale language model finetuning.

**Rating: 9/10**

This is a high-quality paper that presents a novel and principled solution to a significant and challenging problem. The core idea of decomposing trajectory alignment into stepwise posterior alignment is both elegant and effective, cleverly circumventing the optimization difficulties of prior RL-based approaches for discrete diffusion models. The theoretical result (Theorem 4.1) connecting the stepwise objectives to the global trajectory objective provides a strong formal justification for the method. Furthermore, the empirical validation is comprehensive and impressive, showing substantial improvements on diverse, state-of-the-art tasks and models. The work is a solid contribution to the field of generative model alignment and is particularly timely given the growing interest in non-autoregressive sequence models like discrete diffusion models.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Stepwise Decomposition for Trajectory Alignment:** The central idea is to reframe the intractable problem of optimizing a reward over an entire diffusion trajectory `p(x_0:T)` into a set of independent, tractable subproblems. Each subproblem, corresponding to a diffusion step `t`, focuses on aligning the posterior `p_Î¸(x_0|x_t)`, which predicts the final clean sequence `x_0` from a noisy intermediate `x_t`. This decomposition is powerful because rewards are typically defined on the clean data `x_0`, and the posterior is often simple to compute for masked diffusion models, making optimization efficient and exact.

2.  **Theoretical Equivalence under Additive Reward:** The paper provides a crucial theoretical guarantee that this decomposition is not merely a heuristic. Theorem 4.1 establishes that if the reward for the entire trajectory can be factorized as a sum of rewards from each step, then finding the optimal solution for each stepwise alignment subproblem induces a joint distribution that is also the optimal solution for the original, full trajectory alignment problem. This provides a principled foundation for the entire approach.

3.  **Generalized Preference Optimization via Distribution Matching:** The paper derives a flexible and general loss function to solve each stepwise subproblem. By formulating the alignment as matching the model's policy to a reward-weighted reference policy (via KL divergence), they arrive at a loss that can handle arbitrary reward functions and datasets with more than just pairwise preferences (i.e., any number of Monte Carlo samples `N`). This generalizes the popular Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework and provides a stable, offline alternative to volatile RL-based methods.
