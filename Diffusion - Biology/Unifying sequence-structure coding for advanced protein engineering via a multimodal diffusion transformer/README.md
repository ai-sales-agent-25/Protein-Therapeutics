**Relatedness score: 7 / 10**

| Why it *does* connect to your Pareto-FM SaaS                                                                                                                                                               | Why the fit stops short of a 9–10                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Protein-first, generator not just scorer.** PT-DiT actually *creates* new sequences *and* 3-D backbones, so it can serve as a candidate-factory your SaaS could steer or benchmark.                      | **Diffusion-based, not Flow-Matching.** You still need your fast (<15-step) discrete FM objective and straight-path tricks to hit SaaS latency/KPI targets.                                       |
| **Joint sequence + structure latent space.** The paper’s “ProTokens” compress backbone geometry into a discrete vocabulary, giving you a ready plug-in for *structure-aware* rewards or conditioning.      | **No Pareto layer.** It optimises one task at a time; there’s no weight-vector conditioning or dominance-classifier guidance—your slider UI remains unique.                                       |
| **Talks about multi-objective directions.** Authors highlight directed-evolution loops and “diverse objectives” (e.g., scaffolding + dynamics), mirroring the real-world constraints your customers face.  | **Compute footprint & token mismatch.** Model is a 24-layer diffusion transformer and ProTokens aren’t the categorical amino-acid symbols your discrete-FM head expects—extra engineering needed. |
| **Evidence of wet-lab relevance.** Shows experimental validation (CDR grafting, carbonic-anhydrase evolution) that resonates with protein/peptide buyers you’re targeting.                                 | **Cost narrative absent.** Paper optimises for plausibility and diversity, not \$/assay saved; you’ll supply the business-ROI framing.                                                            |

**Take-away:**
PT-DiT is a **strong conceptual cousin**—it confirms that large, generative sequence+structure models are feasible and valuable for advanced protein engineering, and its ProToken idea could enhance your surrogate scoring or conditioning pipeline. But because it lacks Flow-Matching speedups and any explicit Pareto-front guidance, it complements rather than competes with the proprietary core of your protein-design SaaS—hence a solid, but not decisive, **7 / 10** relevance.
