**Toward the Explainability of Protein Language Models for Sequence Design**

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper provides a comprehensive survey and a forward-looking perspective on the application of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to protein language models (pLMs), with a specific focus on generative tasks like protein design. The authors categorize existing XAI techniques based on where they draw information from within the pLM workflow: the training data, the input prompt, the model architecture, or the output sequence. More significantly, they propose a novel conceptual framework that defines five potential roles for XAI in protein research: Evaluator, Multitasker, Engineer, Coach, and Teacher. The paper argues that while the Evaluator role (using XAI to verify that models learn known biological patterns) is common, the other roles remain largely underexplored. It concludes by highlighting critical future needs, including the development of community benchmarks, domain-specific visualization tools, and a focus on risks related to security and bias, ultimately calling for a more integrated use of XAI to move beyond validation and toward genuine scientific discovery.

**Rating: 9/10.** This is an excellent and timely perspective piece. For a PhD-level audience, its primary contribution is not novel experimental data but a well-structured conceptual framework for organizing and advancing a nascent, critical field. The categorization of XAI methods into four information contexts and, more importantly, the five functional roles, provides a much-needed vocabulary and roadmap for researchers. It successfully synthesizes a disparate set of studies into a coherent narrative, clearly articulating the current state, limitations, and immense future potential of making pLMs less of a "black box." It is a valuable resource for both machine learning developers and protein scientists looking to engage with model interpretability.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **A Structured Framework for XAI Application:** The paper systematically organizes XAI methods by breaking down the generative pLM workflow into four distinct "information contexts." This framework allows researchers to strategically choose XAI tools based on the question they are asking. The contexts are:
    *   **Training Dataset:** Using methods like influence functions to understand how biases or specific examples in the training data affect model behavior.
    *   **Input Query:** Applying feature-attribution methods (e.g., gradient-based saliency) to determine which parts of an input sequence (like a prompt) are most important for the generated output.
    *   **Model Components:** Probing the internal architecture of the model, for instance by analyzing attention scores or neuron activations, to understand how the model represents and processes information.
    *   **Output Sequence:** Employing perturbation-based methods like SHAP, LIME, or counterfactual generation to understand what input changes would lead to different outputs, thereby probing the model's decision boundaries.

2.  **Five Functional Roles for XAI in Protein Science:** The authors distill five potential roles that XAI can fulfill, moving from simple validation to active discovery and model improvement. This framework clarifies the *purpose* of applying XAI.
    *   **Evaluator:** The most common current role, where XAI is used to confirm that a model has learned known biological or biophysical principles (e.g., that attention maps correlate with residue contact maps).
    *   **Multitasker:** Using the patterns discovered by the Evaluator to perform a secondary task, such as annotating previously unknown binding sites.
    *   **Engineer:** Using insights about the model's internal workings (e.g., identifying redundant attention heads) to prune or optimize the model architecture for greater efficiency.
    *   **Coach:** Actively steering the model during training or generation by providing feedback on its internal representations, encouraging it to focus on desirable features.
    *   **Teacher:** The most aspirational role, where XAI is used to extract novel, human-understandable scientific principles or a "protein grammar" from the model that advances fundamental biological knowledge.

3.  **A Call for Future Development in Explainable Protein Design:** The paper concludes by identifying key challenges and opportunities. It argues that for the field to advance, especially toward the "Teacher" role, the community must focus on three critical areas:
    *   **Community Benchmarks & Robustness:** Developing standardized methods and benchmarks to evaluate the faithfulness and reliability of XAI explanations themselves.
    *   **Domain-Specific Tooling:** Creating new visualization and analysis tools tailored to protein science, such as projecting saliency maps onto 3D protein structures instead of just 1D sequences.
    *   **Addressing Risks:** Critically examining and using XAI to mitigate risks associated with powerful generative models, including bias, trustworthiness, and security concerns like the generation of harmful proteins.
