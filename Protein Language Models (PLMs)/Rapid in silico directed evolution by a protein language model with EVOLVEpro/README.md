**Rapid in silico directed evolution by a protein language model with EVOLVEpro**

**1. Summary and Rating**

This paper introduces EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework designed to accelerate protein engineering. The central thesis is that large protein language models (PLMs) like ESM2, while powerful at capturing evolutionary patterns, are poor at predicting specific functional activities in a zero-shot manner because evolutionary fitness and engineered function are often uncorrelated. EVOLVEpro addresses this by combining the rich, high-dimensional embeddings from a PLM with a lightweight top-layer regression model (a random forest). In an iterative loop, the framework proposes a small number of mutations, which are experimentally tested. The results are then used to train the regression model to learn the mapping from the PLM's latent space to the specific, desired activity landscape. This allows EVOLVEpro to efficiently navigate sequence space and identify highly active variants with minimal experimental cost. The authors demonstrate the framework's power and versatility by successfully engineering six different proteins for applications in antibody binding, genome editing (CRISPR, Prime Editing, Integrase), and multi-parameter RNA production, achieving up to 515-fold improvements in desired properties and demonstrating its utility for complex, multi-objective optimization problems.

**Rating: 9.5/10**

This is an exceptional paper that addresses a critical and well-recognized bottleneck in computational protein design. The authors clearly articulate the problem—the divergence between PLM-inferred fitness and functional activity—and propose an elegant, practical, and highly effective solution. The methodological rigor is outstanding, featuring comprehensive in silico benchmarking across 12 datasets and extensive experimental validation on six therapeutically relevant and challenging protein systems, including *in vivo* studies. The results are significant, showcasing substantial performance gains over existing state-of-the-art proteins and demonstrating a clear advantage over zero-shot methods. The ability to perform multi-objective optimization on properties incompatible with high-throughput screening is a major advance. The work is a landmark contribution to machine learning-directed evolution, providing a powerful and generalizable tool that significantly lowers the barrier to engineering complex proteins.

**2. Main Ideas**

1.  **The Divergence of Evolutionary Fitness and Engineered Function:** A core concept of the paper is that the fitness landscape learned by PLMs from evolutionary data does not reliably correlate with the specific functional activity landscape required for a given engineering task. The authors demonstrate this empirically across multiple protein targets, showing a weak or even negative correlation between ESM2’s predicted fitness scores (pMMS) and the experimentally measured activity of their evolved mutants. This finding serves as the primary justification for moving beyond zero-shot PLM predictions and developing a data-driven fine-tuning approach.

2.  **Few-Shot Active Learning with a Hybrid PLM-Regressor Model:** The main methodological innovation is EVOLVEpro, which couples a foundational PLM (for sequence representation) with a task-specific regression model (for activity prediction). By using active learning—iteratively testing a small batch of mutants and retraining the regressor—the model efficiently learns the specific rules of the activity landscape for that protein. This "few-shot" approach drastically reduces the experimental burden compared to traditional MLDE, making it feasible for complex assays, while significantly outperforming zero-shot models that lack task-specific experimental feedback.

3.  **Generalizability Across Diverse and Multi-Objective Protein Engineering Tasks:** The paper powerfully demonstrates the versatility of the EVOLVEpro framework by applying it to six distinct and complex protein engineering challenges. These include improving antibody binding affinity and developability, enhancing the editing efficiency of CRISPR nucleases and prime editors, and boosting the activity of a serine integrase. Critically, the successful engineering of T7 RNA polymerase for three simultaneous objectives (yield, translational output, and purity/low immunogenicity) highlights the framework's capacity for sophisticated multi-objective optimization, a major hurdle in protein design.
