| Dimension                                 | Match to your Pareto-aware Flow-Matching SaaS                                                                                                   | Evidence in *PepFlow*                                                                                                                             | What’s still missing (your white-space)                                                        |

| **Flow-matching core**                    | **Exact** – the model is built on *Conditional Flow Matching* with analytic vector fields for every modality (sequence, backbone, side-chains). | “We present **PepFlow**, … a multi-modal deep generative model grounded in the **flow-matching framework**”  ; §3.2 details CFM objective         | You may prefer rectified / one-step FM for lower latency.                                      |
| **Protein / peptide therapeutic scope**   | **High** – focuses on *target-specific* peptide binders and benchmarks sequence-structure co-design against RFdiffusion.                        | Abstract & Introduction describe design of full-atom peptides that bind disease-associated proteins  ; §4.1 binder results                        | No explicit potency assays; still surrogate docking / Rosetta energies.                        |
| **Multi-objective / Pareto optimisation** | **Low** – generates a single “best” binder; authors note the **incapability for property-guided generation** as future work.                    | “Its current incapability for **property-guided generation**, a common requirement in protein optimisation, represents an area for improvement.”  | Your real-time Pareto frontier across potency–stability–manufacturability–safety is untouched. |
| **Guidance / controllability**            | Limited – conditional on receptor pocket, but no classifier or reward guidance; no dynamic weighting between objectives.                        | Sampling algorithm is unconditional beyond receptor context (§3.3 & Alg. 2)                                                                       | Straight-Through or hyper-cone guidance from other papers can slot on top.                     |
| **Manufacturability & safety heads**      | None – focuses on geometric/energetic metrics; no SPPS yield, aggregation, hERG, immunogenicity.                                                | Metrics table includes RMSD, Rosetta energies, etc.                                                                                               | Early CMC-cost and tox predictors remain your moat.                                            |
| **Developer-first / SaaS layer**          | Absent – code promised open-source; no API, versioning, or compliance tooling.                                                                  | “Our method … potential tool for computational peptide design” but no platform discussion                                                         | Your open SDK, audit trail export, uptime SLAs still differentiate you.                        |

### Why it’s a **7** (and not a 5 or a 9)

* **+2** for being a **full-atom, target-aware FM generator** – closer to your tech stack than ProtFlow (latent-only) or FORT (coordinate-only).
* **–3** for lacking *any* multi-objective or Pareto surfacing, plus no manufacturability/safety modules and no productised cloud layer.

### How *PepFlow* can accelerate (but not replace) your roadmap

1. **Multi-modal FM template** – reuse their SE(3)-torus-simplex flows to support backbone-orientation, torsion, and residue-type objectives straight out of the box.
2. **Benchmark baseline** – replicate their co-design task, then show how adding manufacturability & tox heads reshapes the frontier.
3. **Partial-sampling trick** – their “partial state” sampling for side-chain packing (§3.3)  is a neat pattern for letting users lock certain modalities in your UI.

**Bottom line:** *PepFlow* is a strong algorithmic cousin—perfect proof that flow-matching scales to **full-atom, target-aware peptide design**—yet it stops before the **multi-objective, Pareto-front, developer-grade SaaS layer** that defines your product vision.
