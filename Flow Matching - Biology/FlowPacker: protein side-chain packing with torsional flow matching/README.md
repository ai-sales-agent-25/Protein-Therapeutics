| Dimension                            | Match to your Pareto-aware Flow-Matching (FM) peptide-design SaaS                                                          | Evidence in *FlowPacker*                                                             | Where you still differentiate                                                        |

| **Flow-matching DNA**                | **Exact** – adopts *torsional Flow Matching* on the hypertorus for χ-angle generation.                                     | “We apply **torsional flow matching** … to develop FlowPacker”                       | You aim for rectified/one-step FM with multi-objective guidance.                     |
| **Protein / peptide scope**          | Packs side-chains for any protein, including antibodies; useful post-design step for peptides.                             | Claims state-of-the-art side-chain RMSD and runtime on CASP & antibody–antigen sets  | Does **not** design sequences or binders; requires an upstream generator like yours. |
| **Multi-objective / Pareto layer**   | **Absent.** Optimises *single* structural accuracy metric; no potency, solubility, manufacturability or safety trade-offs. | Evaluation focuses on χ-angle MAE / atom RMSD only                                   | Your USP is real-time potency–stability–CMC–safety Pareto frontiers.                 |
| **Developer-first / SaaS angle**     | Research code on GitLab; no API, versioning, or compliance workflow.                                                       | “Code is available at …/flowpacker”                                                  | You deliver the cloud SDK, usage-based billing and audit exports.                    |
| **Manufacturability & safety heads** | None – purely geometric; no SPPS yield, aggregation, hERG, immunogenicity predictors.                                      | Such objectives never appear in methods or results                                   | Early CMC cost & tox scoring remains your moat.                                      |
| **Speed & composability**            | Faster than DiffPack/AttnPacker; supports in-painting and multimeric complexes—handy for a SaaS pipeline.                  | Runtime vs. RMSD plots and antibody test case §3–4                                   | You still need end-to-end integration (sequence → structure → Pareto scoring).       |

### Why it lands in the middle

* **+** Shares the same FM paradigm and could plug into your backend to convert Pareto-optimal sequences into full-atom structures quickly—valuable for manufacturability/tox calculators.
* **−** Stops at *single-objective* side-chain packing with no domain-specific property heads, no target conditioning, and no productised developer experience.

### How it could accelerate (but not replace) your roadmap

1. **Drop-in side-chain module:** use FlowPacker after your generator to supply high-quality all-atom coordinates before running CMC or safety predictions.
2. **Torsion-FM recipe:** borrow their hypertorus FM loss for any torsional sub-task (e.g., macrocycle linker design).
3. **Fast preview path:** leverage its ≤10-step Euler ODE to give users instant “look & feel” structures while heavier Pareto analysis runs asynchronously.

**Bottom line:** FlowPacker is a **useful complementary building block**—hence a 5/10—helpful for final structure refinement, but it doesn’t address the multi-objective optimisation, manufacturability economics, or developer-centric SaaS features that define your product vision.
