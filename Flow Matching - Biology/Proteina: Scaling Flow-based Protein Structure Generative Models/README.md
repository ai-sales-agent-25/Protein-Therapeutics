| Dimension                            | How *Proteína* overlaps with your Pareto-aware Flow-Matching SaaS                                                                                                 | Evidence in the paper                                                                                                                        | Where you still differentiate                                                                       |

| **Flow-matching backbone**           | **Exact match.** Uses Conditional Flow Matching (rectified flow) to map Gaussian noise to protein backbones.                                                      | “We set out to scale protein structure generation and develop a **flow-matching–based** protein backbone generative model called Proteína.”  | You may prefer rectified-flow **one-step** or forward-only surrogates for sub-second SaaS latency.  |
| **Scale & speed narrative**          | Trains 60 M – 400 M-parameter transformers on **21 M** synthetic structures and samples up to **800-residue** backbones, validating FM at foundation-model scale. | Data-scaling and efficiency analyses (§3.1, Fig. 14; long-chain results Fig. 8).                                                             | Model is still multi-step (400 ODE/SDE steps); you’ll expose an even faster “instant-preview” mode. |
| **Controllability**                  | Introduces hierarchical **fold-class conditioning** (C/A/T levels) plus classifier-free & autoguidance, giving coarse structural control.                         | Fold-class guidance experiments (§4.3, Tab. 4).                                                                                              | No conditioning on potency, solubility, manufacturability, or safety objectives.                    |
| **Protein / peptide focus**          | Generates backbones for **proteins (≤800 aa)**; applicable to peptide scaffolds but not tuned to therapeutic-length peptides or target binding.                   | Model operates on Cα coordinates only and avoids side-chains (§3.2).                                                                         | Your engine specialises in 10-50 aa therapeutic peptides with target-aware potency heads.           |
| **Multi-objective / Pareto layer**   | **Absent.** Paper optimises a single backbone quality distribution; authors do not expose trade-offs across competing biophysical properties.                     | Benchmarks track designability/diversity but no multi-objective optimisation is described (§4.1).                                            | You provide live potency–stability–CMC–safety Pareto frontiers.                                     |
| **Manufacturability & safety heads** | None – no SPPS yield, oxidation, immunogenicity or hERG predictors.                                                                                               | Entire evaluation focuses on geometric/novelty metrics; such terms never appear in objectives.                                               | Early CMC costing and tox screening remain your clear moat.                                         |
| **Developer-first SaaS layer**       | Research code promised on GitHub; no API, uptime, versioning or compliance tooling.                                                                               | “Code will be publicly released…” (abstract).                                                                                                | Your open-core SDK, billing, audit export and UI are untouched.                                     |

### Why it’s a solid **6/10** (and not the 9–10 others gave)

* **+** Shares your flow-matching DNA and demonstrates that FM can scale to foundation-model size.
* **＋** Fold-class conditioning ideas could inspire your own plug-in guidance interface.
* **–** Lacks the *multi-objective*, *therapeutic-peptide* and *manufacturability/safety* layers that define your product.
* **–** Provides no SaaS infrastructure or developer ergonomics.

### How to leverage it without losing your edge

1. **Borrow the scalable transformer & data-pipeline tricks** (21 M structures, LoRA fine-tuning).
2. **Adapt fold-class conditioning** as a template for *objective conditioning*: swap “class labels” for potency/CMC/tox predictors and add weight-vector guidance.
3. **Distil to a one-step surrogate** to meet interactive latency targets.
4. **Benchmark** on their long-chain tasks, then showcase how adding manufacturability cost reshapes the design frontier in your UI.

In short, *Proteína* is an impressive large-scale FM backbone generator you can mine for architecture, data-scaling and guidance ideas, yet it stops well before the **multi-objective, developer-centric peptide-therapeutics SaaS** vision you’re building.
