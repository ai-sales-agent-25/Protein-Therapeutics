| **Flow-matching backbone**             | **Exact** – built on *Conditional Flow Matching* for torsion angles (hypertorus), translations (ℝ³) and rotations (SO(3)).                                      | Abstract and §3 derive the torus-CFM loss and SE(3) / amino-acid flows | You may prefer rectified/one-step FM for sub-second latency.                            |
| **Peptide-therapeutic focus**          | **High** – designs receptor-specific peptides (≤ 30 aa), reports binding ΔG, stability, novelty, diversity vs. competing baselines.                             | §5.3 Table 1 & discussion                                              | Still surrogate docking; no wet-lab potency or developability data.                     |
| **Multi-objective / Pareto awareness** | **Low** – evaluates several metrics post-hoc but **does not optimise them jointly**; authors flag “incapability for property-guided generation” as future work. | Limitations note in §4 Related Work                                    | Your real-time potency–stability–CMC–safety frontier remains white-space.               |
| **Guidance / controllability**         | Limited – conditioning only on target receptor; no classifier guidance or weight-vector scheme.                                                                 | Algorithm 2 only steps ODE without objective heads                     | You can bolt on predictor-guidance (e.g., ParetoFlow-style) for interactive trade-offs. |
| **Manufacturability & safety heads**   | **Absent.** Metrics stop at ΔG, stability and chemical validity; no SPPS yield, oxidation, immunogenicity, hERG, cost.                                          | No such terms appear in objectives or experiments                      | Early CMC & tox scoring is your USP.                                                    |
| **Developer-first SaaS layer**         | None – open-source code promised, but no API, versioning, audit/export features.                                                                                | GitHub link only                                                       | Your cloud SDK, compliance export and billing tier remain unique.                       |

### Why it lands at **7 / 10**

* **+** Shares the same flow-matching DNA and is explicitly *peptide-target aware*, so it’s far more pertinent than diffusion-only or small-molecule FM papers.
* **–** Lacks true multi-objective / Pareto optimisation, manufacturability & safety modules, and any SaaS productisation – the heart of your differentiation.

### How you could leverage it

1. **Torsion-CFM template** – reuse their torus-SE(3) formulation to support backbone generators that respect rigid-body chemistry while keeping bonds intact.
2. **Benchmark baseline** – replicate their PPBench task, then show how adding manufacturability cost and tox heads reshapes the frontier in your UI.
3. **Partial-state editing** – their “perturb-then-ODE” optimisation (§5.4) is a ready-made UX pattern for letting users fine-tune existing peptides with slider-controlled noise.

*Bottom line:* *PPFlow* is a strong algorithmic cousin—excellent proof that flow-matching scales to **target-aware peptide design**—but it stops short of the **multi-objective, developer-centred SaaS platform with early CMC and safety intelligence** that defines your product vision.
