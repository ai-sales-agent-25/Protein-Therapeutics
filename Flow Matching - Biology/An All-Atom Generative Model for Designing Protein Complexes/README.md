| Why it’s strongly aligned with your Pareto-FM SaaS                                                                                                                                                                               | Where it still diverges                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Built on Flow-Matching.** The core *Seq & BB* module trains an SE(3) vector-field with the FM loss to co-generate sequence + backbone—exactly the algorithmic family you plan to commercialise.                                | **No Pareto or dominance guidance.** Optimisation targets one scalar at a time (binding affinity or energy); it lacks the weight-vector conditioning / real-time slider that is your signature feature.                |
| **All-atom, multi-chain protein complexes.** APM goes beyond single chains, modelling side-chains and inter-chain contacts—valuable for the binder, peptide and antibody use-cases that anchor your wedge market.                | **Sequence redesign is backbone-coupled.** The generator assumes you want to make complexes from scratch rather than tune hyper-parameters or broader Pareto trade-offs across manufacturability, immunogenicity, etc. |
| **Prior-injection & modular refinement.** Their three-stage architecture (Flow FM → side-chain packer → all-atom refiner) offers ready engineering patterns you can reuse for latency-vs-quality knobs in a SaaS tiering model.  | **Inference-cost not optimised.** No step-reduction or straight-path tricks; you’d still need your <15-solver-step budget to keep per-proposal pricing attractive.                                                     |
| **Demonstrated on antibodies & peptides.** The paper shows state-of-the-art results in CDR-H3 and peptide binders—exactly the assays your earliest customers run.                                                                | **Business plumbing absent.** No discussion of GxP/HIPAA deployment, VPC isolation, or pay-per-evaluation economics—the layer you monetize.                                                                            |

**Take-away:**
APM is a close technical cousin—proving that flow-matching can scale to *all-atom, multi-chain* design and offering transferable tricks for prior conditioning and refinement. Because it lacks explicit Pareto-front steering and SaaS-grade efficiency/compliance, it complements rather than competes with the proprietary layer (multi-objective slider, solver-step shortcuts, regulated deployment) that defines your protein/peptide optimisation platform—hence a solid **8 / 10** relevance.
