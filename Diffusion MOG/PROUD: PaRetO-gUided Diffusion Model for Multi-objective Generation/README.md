\*\*Relevance score — \*\* **5 / 10**

| Dimension                                | Match to your Pareto-aware Flow-Matching SaaS                                                                                                                 | Evidence in *PROUD*                                                                                                         | What’s still missing (your white-space)                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generative backbone**                  | **Moderate.** Uses a **diffusion** model, not flow-matching, but both families are continuous-time generative flows—ideas around gradient guidance translate. | “We introduce the PaRetO-gUided **Diffusion** model (PROUD) … gradients in the denoising process are dynamically adjusted”  | You’d need to port their constrained-optimisation trick to a flow-matching velocity field.                            |
| **Pareto / multi-objective focus**       | **High.** PROUD is built expressly to keep samples on the **Pareto front** while preserving sample quality; exactly your UX promise.                          | Formulates “a constrained optimisation … minimise KL while generated samples reside at the Pareto front” (§4)               | No live frontier explorer or interactive trade-off sliders; lacks crowding-distance diversity tools you already plan. |
| **Protein / peptide therapeutics scope** | **Good.** One of two benchmark domains is **protein design** (antibody-sequence task).                                                                        | “Experimental evaluations on image generation **and protein generation** tasks demonstrate …”                               | Protein task optimises SASA + β-sheet % only; no explicit potency, manufacturability, or tox heads.                   |
| **Guidance mechanics**                   | Useful. Dynamically solves a **constrained Lagrangian** each denoise step—can inspire your multi-objective weighting.                                         | Eq. (12–15) derive λᵢ,t weights from MGD & KL terms                                                                         | Their λ solves only two or three objectives; you’ll extend to 4-5 (potency, stability, CMC, safety).                  |
| **Flow-matching DNA**                    | **Low.** No flow-matching training or rectified-flow inference; FM appears only in related-work citations.                                                    | Entire derivation is DDPM-style; RF/FM not mentioned in method.                                                             | Your engine’s claim of *instant* FM sampling and forward-only surrogates remains intact.                              |
| **Developer-first / SaaS layer**         | None. Promises open code but no cloud, SDK, or compliance workflow.                                                                                           | “The code of this work will be publicly released on GitHub.”                                                                | Your open-core cloud, versioning, audit trails, and CMC cost widgets still differentiate you.                         |

### Why it lands in the middle (5/10)

* **Big conceptual overlap** on multi-objective, Pareto-aware generation **⟹ pushes score above 3–4**.
* **But backbone mismatch (diffusion ≠ flow-matching)** and lack of manufacturability/safety modules **⟹ keeps it below 7**.

### Take-aways for your roadmap

1. **Steal the constrained-KL Lagrangian idea.** Swap their diffusion score with your flow field to weight potency vs. stability vs. cost on-the-fly.
2. **Benchmark diversity regulariser (§4.4).** Their inverse-distance loss could seed your frontier-spread metric.
3. **Show extra axes.** Re-run their antibody SES task, then add manufacturability & tox objectives to highlight the value of your expanded predictor suite.

Bottom line: *PROUD* validates that Pareto-guided sampling is hot, but it leaves the **flow-matching engine, rich therapeutic objectives, and developer-grade SaaS wrapper** entirely to you—hence a **solid yet not decisive 5 / 10** relevance.
