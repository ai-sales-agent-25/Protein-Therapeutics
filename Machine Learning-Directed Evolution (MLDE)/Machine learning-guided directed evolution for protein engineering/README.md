Yang et al. 2019. Machine-learning-guided directed evolution for protein engineering. This work is a foundational paper in the field of Machine Learning-Directed Evolution (MLDE), establishing the paradigm of using machine learning to guide laboratory evolution that EVOLVEpro refines into a more data-efficient process. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0496-6
