Protenix-Mini: Efficient Structure Predictor via Compact Architecture, Few-Step Diffusion and Switchable PLM

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper presents Protenix-Mini, a computationally efficient variant of the Protenix protein structure predictor, which itself is an open-source reproduction of AlphaFold3. The authors achieve significant gains in inference speed and reductions in computational cost by making three key modifications: (1) replacing the expensive multi-step diffusion sampler with a highly optimized two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampler, (2) pruning redundant Pairformer and Diffusion Transformer blocks from the model architecture, and (3) introducing a variant that replaces the computationally intensive Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) search module with a pre-trained protein language model (pLM), specifically ESM2.

The authors systematically analyze the trade-offs between computational cost and prediction accuracy. Their results demonstrate that Protenix-Mini, with its compact architecture and two-step sampler, achieves predictions with only a marginal (1-5%) decrease in accuracy compared to the full-scale Protenix model. A further pruned version, Protenix-Tiny, reduces computational cost by approximately 85% with a slightly larger accuracy drop. This work provides a practical and well-engineered pathway for deploying state-of-the-art structure prediction models in resource-constrained environments or for large-scale applications like high-throughput screening.

**Rating: 8.5/10**

The paper is a strong piece of engineering research. It addresses the critical and practical challenge of making large-scale biomolecular structure prediction models more efficient. The methodological contributions are not fundamentally novel (model pruning, few-step ODE sampling, and pLM substitution have been explored in other contexts), but their systematic application, rigorous evaluation, and insightful analysis within the context of a state-of-the-art AlphaFold3-style architecture are highly valuable. The clear demonstration of the speed-accuracy trade-off provides an important blueprint for future work in this area. For a PhD-level audience, it serves as an excellent example of targeted optimization and ablation studies that bridge the gap between cutting-edge models and their practical deployment.

### 2. Main Ideas Discussed

1.  **Efficient Sampling via Few-Step ODEs:** A core contribution is the demonstration that the computationally intensive diffusion process, which can involve hundreds of steps in models like AlphaFold3, can be drastically accelerated. By reconfiguring the sampler to a deterministic ODE-based approach (specifically by setting hyperparameters `η=1.0` and `γ₀=0`) and reducing the number of integration steps to as few as two, the model can generate high-quality structures with minimal performance degradation. This challenges the conventional wisdom that high-fidelity sampling requires long, iterative trajectories.
2.  **Architectural Compression via Pruning:** The paper identifies significant redundancy in the deep transformer-based architecture of Protenix. Through systematic ablation, the authors show that a substantial number of Pairformer blocks can be removed from the model post-training (and without retraining) with only a slight drop in performance. This insight motivates the training of smaller, more compact models from scratch (Protenix-Mini and Protenix-Tiny) that are inherently more efficient.
3.  **Replacing MSA with Pre-trained Language Models (pLMs):** To bypass the time-consuming and resource-intensive process of searching for Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs), the authors propose substituting the MSA module entirely. They use embeddings from the ESM2 protein language model as an alternative input. They develop a hybrid training strategy to distill knowledge from the MSA-based pathway into the pLM-based one, creating a model that can perform inference directly from a protein sequence, further streamlining the prediction pipeline.
