UNAVAILABILITY OF EXPERIMENTAL 3D STRUCTURAL DATA ON PROTEIN FOLDING DYNAMICS AND NECESSITY FOR A NEW GENERATION OF STRUCTURE PREDICTION METHODS IN THIS CONTEXT

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper serves as a comprehensive review and perspective on the state of protein folding dynamics research, with a specific focus on the availability of 3D structural data for folding intermediates. The authors begin by highlighting a critical bottleneck in the field: the extreme scarcity of experimentally determined 3D structures for both post-translational and co-translational folding intermediates. Their literature search identifies only a handful of such studies (two for post-translational and four for co-translational), which they centralize and analyze.

The core of the paper investigates whether modern computational structure prediction methods, designed for native states, can bridge this data gap. Through their own original analysis and by citing recent literature, they demonstrate that AlphaFold2 performs poorly when predicting the structures of non-native intermediates, reinforcing the conclusion that these tools do not generalize well beyond native conformations. The paper then explores nascent computational approaches designed explicitly for folding pathways, including the "Pathfinder" method and the authors' own "proxy" intermediates concept. The authors conclude by making a strong case for a concerted effort from both experimental and computational communities to generate new intermediate-specific data and to develop a new generation of prediction methods that accurately account for the biophysical dynamics of the folding process.

**Rating: 9/10**

This is an excellent and timely perspective piece that would be highly valuable to a PhD-level audience in computational biology or biophysics. It clearly articulates a significant and underexplored problem. The paper's strength lies in its synthesis of the current landscape, combining a thorough literature review with original, demonstrative analysis. By systematically showing the failure of state-of-the-art tools like AlphaFold2 on this specific task, it provides a compelling "call to arms" for the field. While it doesn't introduce a new breakthrough method itself, it defines the problem, consolidates the sparse existing data, and outlines a clear path for future research, making it a valuable strategic document for any researcher interested in protein folding dynamics.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **A Critical Lack of Experimental Data:** The paper's primary argument is that there is a fundamental lack of experimentally determined 3D structural data for protein folding intermediates. The authors' search reveals only six studies in total that provide such data, creating a major obstacle for understanding folding mechanisms and for developing and validating computational models. This data sparsity for transient states is contrasted with the wealth of data available for final, native structures.
2.  **Failure of Native Structure Predictors for Folding Intermediates:** A key finding, supported by the authors' original analysis and other recent work, is that powerful native structure prediction tools like AlphaFold2 are not adept at predicting the 3D structures of non-native folding intermediates. While unparalleled for native state prediction, these methods fail to capture the distinct conformations of intermediates, suggesting they are not learning the underlying physics of the folding process and cannot be naively repurposed for this task.
3.  **The Need for a New Generation of Dynamic-Aware Methods:** The paper argues that overcoming the current impasse requires a new class of computational methods specifically designed to predict folding pathways, not just final structures. These future methods should incorporate the biophysical and temporal aspects of folding, such as the vectorial nature of co-translational folding, ribosome interactions, and non-native contacts. The paper highlights early attempts in this direction as promising but underscores the need for more significant innovation, catalyzed by new experimental data.
