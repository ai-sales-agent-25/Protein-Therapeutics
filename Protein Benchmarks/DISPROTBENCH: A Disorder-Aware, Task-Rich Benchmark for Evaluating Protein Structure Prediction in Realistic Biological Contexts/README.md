**Paper:** DISPROTBENCH: A Disorder-Aware, Task-Rich Benchmark for Evaluating Protein Structure Prediction in Realistic Biological Contexts

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) in biologically realistic contexts, with a specific focus on intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The authors argue that existing benchmarks like CASP and CAID are insufficient because they either focus on well-folded domains or simple binary disorder classification, failing to assess model performance on functional tasks where IDRs are critical (e.g., protein-protein interactions, drug discovery).

DisProtBench is built on three pillars: (1) **Data Complexity**, using curated datasets of disease-associated proteins, GPCR-ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes rich in disorder; (2) **Task Diversity**, evaluating twelve leading PSPMs on downstream tasks like PPI prediction and ligand binding affinity; and (3) **Interpretability**, via an interactive web portal for visual error analysis and model comparison. A key methodological contribution is the validation and use of the pLDDT confidence score as a proxy for disorder, allowing for stratified analysis that reveals how model performance degrades in low-confidence regions. The results show that while some models (like AlphaFold3) are robust, many struggle with IDRs, and this weakness is often masked by global accuracy metrics. The benchmark highlights that tasks involving extended interfaces (PPIs) are more severely affected by disorder than those involving localized binding pockets (drug discovery).

**Rating: 9/10**

This paper is a high-quality and timely contribution to the field. It addresses a critical and widely acknowledged gap: the systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art structure predictors on the challenging but functionally vital "dark proteome." The framework is methodologically rigorous, comprehensive in its inclusion of diverse models and tasks, and biologically grounded. The development of an interactive portal significantly enhances its practical utility and accessibility, moving beyond a static leaderboard. The key insight—that functional reliability in disordered contexts cannot be inferred from global structural accuracy—is convincingly demonstrated and provides crucial guidance for the future development and application of PSPMs. The paper is well-written, the experiments are well-designed, and its conclusions are impactful for both computational model developers and experimental biologists.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Existing Benchmarks are Insufficient for Real-World Biology:** Current benchmarks for protein structure prediction, such as CASP, focus heavily on the accuracy of well-folded, static structures. This overlooks the performance on intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are central to many dynamic biological processes like signaling and molecular recognition. DisProtBench argues that without evaluating models on these complex and disordered systems, our understanding of their true capabilities and limitations in realistic biomedical scenarios is incomplete.
2.  **A Multi-Axis, Function-Oriented Evaluation is Necessary:** To properly assess PSPMs, the paper proposes a "disorder-aware, task-rich" evaluation framework. This involves three key axes: curating **biologically complex data** (IDRs, complexes, ligand-bound states), benchmarking on functional downstream **tasks** (PPI prediction, drug-binding), and enabling **interpretability** through a visual portal. This approach shifts the focus from mere structural accuracy to functional reliability.
3.  **pLDDT Score is a Valid Proxy for Disorder and Reveals Task-Specific Vulnerabilities:** The paper empirically demonstrates that a low pLDDT score (a model's internal confidence metric) strongly correlates with disordered regions. By stratifying evaluations based on pLDDT, they show that IDRs significantly impair model performance on tasks like PPI prediction, which rely on accurately modeling extended and flexible interfaces. In contrast, tasks like drug discovery, which often depend on localized and well-structured binding pockets, are more robust to disorder elsewhere in the protein.
