**Paper:** THE LATENT ROAD TO ATOMS: BACKMAPPING COARSE-GRAINED PROTEIN STRUCTURES WITH LATENT DIFFUSION

### 1. Summary and Rating

**Summary:**
This paper introduces Latent Diffusion Backmapping (LDB), a novel generative model for reconstructing all-atom protein structures from their coarse-grained (CG) representations. The core challenge in backmapping is the high dimensionality and vast conformational space of proteins, which makes it difficult for models to generate structures that are both diverse and physically realistic. LDB addresses this by performing a denoising diffusion process not in the high-dimensional 3D coordinate space, but in a compressed, discrete, low-dimensional latent space.

The framework first employs an SE(3)-equivariant Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode all-atom structures into discrete latent codes. This step inherently captures local structural relationships and simplifies the generative task. Subsequently, a conditional diffusion model, conditioned on the input CG coordinates, learns to generate these latent codes. By operating in this simplified latent space, LDB avoids the complexities of directly managing geometric constraints and equivariance during diffusion, leading to a more stable, efficient, and scalable process. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (PED, ATLAS, PDB) that LDB achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating structurally accurate and chemically valid atomic conformations, outperforming previous methods in both fidelity and its ability to capture conformational diversity.

**Rating: 9/10**
This is a high-quality paper that presents a significant advance in protein structure modeling. The application of latent diffusion, inspired by its success in image generation, to the problem of protein backmapping is both novel and elegantly executed. The methodological design is strong, combining an equivariant VQ-VAE for robust latent space creation with a conditional diffusion model for generation. This architecture cleverly sidesteps many of the challenges associated with generating 3D structures directly, such as ensuring chemical validity and handling rotational/translational symmetries. The experimental validation is comprehensive, using multiple challenging datasets and strong, recent baselines to demonstrate superior performance across key metrics. The ablation studies further justify their specific architectural choices (discrete latent space and diffusion over flow-matching). For a PhD-level audience, this work is impressive in its clear articulation of the problem, the sophistication of the proposed solution, and the rigor of its evaluation. It represents a valuable contribution that effectively bridges the gap between efficient coarse-grained simulations and necessary all-atom analyses.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Diffusion in a Discrete Latent Space:** The central idea is to perform the generative process in a compressed, discrete latent space rather than the native 3D coordinate space. An autoencoder first learns a "codebook" of structural motifs. The diffusion model then learns to generate sequences of these codes, conditioned on the CG input. This simplifies the task by reducing dimensionality and abstracting away complex geometric details, making the process more computationally efficient and stable, especially for large proteins.

2.  **Equivariant Encoding and Internal Coordinate Decoding:** The model ensures physical realism and geometric consistency through two key mechanisms. First, it uses an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network as its encoder, meaning the learned latent representation is invariant to the rotation and translation of the input protein. Second, the decoder reconstructs the all-atom structure by generating internal coordinates (bond lengths, angles, dihedrals) rather than Cartesian coordinates. This enforces chemically valid local geometry and avoids the need for expensive post-processing or refinement steps.

3.  **Conditional Generation for Conformational Diversity:** The diffusion process is conditioned on the input coarse-grained structure. This allows LDB to not only reconstruct a single plausible structure but also to effectively sample from the distribution of all-atom conformations that correspond to a given CG representation. Experiments on the ATLAS dataset, which contains large conformational ensembles, demonstrate that this approach is particularly effective at capturing the thermodynamic diversity of protein structures, a key weakness in many prior deterministic and generative models.
