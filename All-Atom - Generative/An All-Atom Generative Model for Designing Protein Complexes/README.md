An All-Atom Generative Model for Designing Protein Complexes

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces the All-Atom Protein Generative Model (APM), a novel framework for designing multi-chain protein complexes. APM addresses key challenges in protein design by natively modeling multi-chain interactions at an all-atom level of detail, a significant step beyond prevalent single-chain or residue-level models. The model architecture is composed of three modules: a `Seq&BB Module` that uses flow matching to co-generate sequence and backbone structure, a `Sidechain Module` for predicting sidechain torsion angles, and a `Refine Module` for all-atom refinement. This modular design, combined with a two-phase training strategy and the integration of a protein language model (ESM2), allows APM to generate novel protein complexes from scratch. The paper demonstrates the model's versatility and effectiveness across a range of tasks, including unconditional generation of tightly binding complexes, multi-chain folding/inverse-folding, and functional protein design. Notably, APM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance in downstream applications like antibody CDR-H3 co-design and binding peptide design, in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning settings.

**Rating: 9/10**

The paper presents a significant and timely contribution to the field of computational protein design. It tackles the difficult and highly relevant problem of multi-chain, all-atom generation with a sophisticated and well-engineered solution. The architectural choice to combine flow-matching for backbone/sequence generation with dedicated modules for sidechain packing and refinement is both novel and effective. The breadth of the evaluation is impressive, covering foundational tasks and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in critical applications like antibody and peptide design. The work pushes the boundaries from predictive models towards generative ones that can design functional biomolecular machinery, which is a key goal for the field. The paper is clear, methodologically sound, and the results strongly support its claims. It falls just short of a perfect score as the multi-chain generation appears most effective for dimers and its performance in the foundational task of folding does not surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **A Unified Generative Framework for All-Atom Multi-Chain Complexes:** The core contribution is APM, a single, end-to-end generative model that designs both the amino acid sequence and the complete all-atom 3D structure of multi-chain protein complexes. This unified approach contrasts with prior work that often required multi-step pipelines involving separate models for backbone generation, sequence design, and sidechain packing. APM integrates these capabilities into one cohesive framework.

2.  **Modular, Flow-Matching-Based Architecture:** APM's architecture cleverly decomposes the complex generation task into three manageable stages. It uses **flow matching**, a modern generative modeling technique, to simultaneously learn the distribution of protein sequences (discrete flow matching) and backbone structures (SE(3) flow matching). This is handled by the `Seq&BB Module`. Subsequent modules then add all-atom detail (`Sidechain Module`) and perform iterative refinement (`Refine Module`), allowing the model to progressively build a high-quality, physically plausible protein complex from noise.

3.  **Native Multi-Chain Modeling and Task Versatility:** The model is explicitly designed to handle multiple protein chains without artificial constraints (like pseudo-linkers), enabling it to learn and generate realistic inter-chain interfaces. The paper thoroughly demonstrates this capability by generating tightly-binding de novo complexes. Furthermore, the framework is shown to be highly versatile, achieving strong performance on a wide array of tasks including single- and multi-chain folding, inverse-folding, and, most notably, functional protein design for antibodies and peptides, where it sets a new state of the art.
