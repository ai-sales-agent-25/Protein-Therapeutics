BAGEL: PROTEIN ENGINEERING VIA EXPLORATION OF AN ENERGY LANDSCAPE

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces BAGEL (Biomolecular Algorithm for Guidance in Energy Landscapes), a modular, open-source Python framework for programmable protein engineering. The authors address the rigidity and specificity of existing deep learning-based design pipelines, which are often ill-suited for custom, multi-objective, or non-differentiable design goals. BAGEL reframes protein design as an energy landscape exploration problem, where a user defines a custom energy function composed of various weighted terms (e.g., geometric constraints, structural confidence metrics, embedding similarities). The framework then employs gradient-free sampling methods, primarily Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to explore the sequence space and identify candidate proteins that minimize this energy function. Key features of BAGEL include its model-agnostic architecture (allowing seamless integration of different deep learning "oracles" like ESMFold), native support for multi-state optimization (e.g., designing a binder to be selective for one target over another), and a flexible, user-friendly interface. The paper demonstrates the framework's versatility across four applications: de novo peptide binder design, targeting intrinsically disordered regions, multi-state selective binding, and generative sampling of enzyme variants. BAGEL's primary goal is to democratize protein design by abstracting complex implementation details and providing a powerful, adaptable tool for the broader scientific community.

**Rating: 9/10**

For a PhD-level audience, this paper presents a significant contribution to the computational protein design toolkit. Its strength lies not in developing a new predictive model, but in creating a robust, highly flexible, and conceptually elegant framework that synthesizes the power of existing state-of-the-art models. The formalization of protein design as the minimization of a user-defined, modular energy function via gradient-free methods is powerful, as it circumvents the limitations of differentiability required by methods like hallucination and offers greater customizability than fixed generative pipelines. The engineering choice to make the framework model-agnostic via the `boileroom` backend is particularly insightful, ensuring BAGEL can adapt and "withstand the test of time" by easily incorporating future, more powerful oracles. The inclusion of multi-state optimization is a critical feature for tackling real-world biological problems like specificity. The paper is exceptionally well-written and clear, and the provided examples effectively showcase the framework's breadth. The only reason for not awarding a perfect score is the inherent limitation, which the authors acknowledge, that the designs are presented without experimental validation. However, as a methods paper introducing a powerful new research tool, the work is outstanding.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Protein Design as Programmable Energy Landscape Exploration:** The central idea of BAGEL is to abstract protein design into a search problem on a custom energy landscape. Instead of relying on rigid, pre-defined pipelines (e.g., backbone generation -> inverse folding), users can program their design objectives by combining various "Energy Terms" into a single loss function. The system then uses MCMC sampling to find sequences that occupy low-energy regions of this landscape. This makes the design process transparent, highly customizable, and applicable to goals that are non-differentiable or difficult to express in other frameworks.

2.  **A Modular and Model-Agnostic Architecture:** BAGEL is built from the ground up with modularity in mind. It separates the core components of a design problem: the `System` (the overall goal), `States` (specific functional contexts), `Chains` (the proteins), `EnergyTerms` (the objectives), `Oracles` (external prediction models like ESMFold), and `Minimizers` (the optimization algorithms). This architecture not only makes it easy for users to define complex problems but, crucially, makes the framework "model-agnostic." It can readily integrate new and improved folding or language models as they become available, preventing obsolescence and allowing for direct benchmarking.

3.  **Native Support for Multi-State and Generative Design Tasks:** The framework's structure inherently supports complex design challenges beyond simple optimization. By defining a `System` with multiple `States` (e.g., a "binding" state with a target and an "avoiding" state with an off-target), BAGEL can perform multi-objective optimization for properties like binding selectivity. Furthermore, by adjusting the sampling temperature in the MCMC algorithm, the framework can be used not just to find a single optimal sequence (optimization) but to generate a diverse ensemble of viable candidates that satisfy the design constraints (generative sampling), as demonstrated in the enzyme variant example.
