Scratch That? De Novo Antibody Design Enters the AI Drug Discovery Toolbox

### 1. Summary and Rating

This news feature provides a timely overview of the rapidly advancing field of AI-driven antibody design, focusing on the distinction and ongoing debate between *de novo* design (creating antibodies from scratch) and optimization of existing scaffolds. The article highlights pioneering work from academic labs like David Baker's (RFdiffusion for antibody loops) and startups like Nabla Bio (JAM platform for designing antibodies to difficult targets like GPCRs). It contrasts these approaches with those of companies like Absci and Generate: Biomedicines, which have faced public criticism for labeling antibodies derived from existing binders (like trastuzumab) as *de novo*. The author interviews key figures from these companies and labs, capturing the tension between the need for precise scientific terminology in academic circles and the pragmatic, results-oriented focus of the biotech industry. Ultimately, the article concludes that while the "is it *de novo*?" debate is important for scientific progress, the shared goal across the industry is to leverage the entire AI toolbox—both optimization and true *de novo* design—to accelerate the delivery of effective therapeutics to patients.

**Rating: 8/10**

For a sophisticated, PhD-level audience, this article serves as an excellent and concise situational analysis of a commercially and scientifically "hot" field. It is not primary research, but as a news feature, it effectively synthesizes recent key preprints and commercial developments, highlights the central controversies and terminology disputes, and provides valuable context by quoting the principal investigators and executives involved. Its strength lies in clearly articulating the nuanced conflict between scientific purism and industrial pragmatism. It would be highly valuable for a researcher entering this subfield to quickly get up to speed on the key players, technologies, and current debates.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **The Rise of Two AI-Driven Antibody Engineering Paradigms:** The field of therapeutic protein design is being rapidly transformed by generative AI, which is manifesting in two primary approaches: true *de novo* design, where antibodies are computationally created from scratch without a known template (e.g., Nabla Bio's work on GPCRs, Baker Lab's RFdiffusion), and generative optimization, where AI models are used to rapidly improve or modify existing protein scaffolds for enhanced properties (e.g., Generate's GB-0669).

2.  **A Central Controversy over "De Novo" Terminology:** A major point of contention within the industry revolves around the definition of "*de novo*." Companies like Absci and Generate: Biomedicines have been criticized for using the term to describe work that started from or was heavily based on existing antibodies. This debate highlights the tension between scientific accuracy, where methodological distinctions are critical, and corporate communication, which may favor more impactful, headline-grabbing language.

3.  **The Ultimate Goal Transcends Terminology:** Despite the debates, the article emphasizes a shared mission to bring better drugs to the clinic faster. The consensus among the experts quoted is that both optimization and *de novo* design are powerful, valuable tools. The strategic choice of which to use depends on the specific clinical problem, and from a patient or investor perspective, the success of the resulting therapeutic is more important than the specific underlying methodology.
