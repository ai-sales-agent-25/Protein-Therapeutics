BindCraft: one-shot design of functional protein binders

**1. Summary and Rating**

This paper introduces BindCraft, a novel open-source computational pipeline for the *de novo* design of high-affinity protein binders. The method's core innovation is its use of backpropagation through the AlphaFold2 (AF2) multimer network to co-design the backbone and sequence of a binder against a specified protein target. This "hallucination" approach allows for the generation of binders without requiring a known binding site or extensive experimental screening. The authors demonstrate the pipeline's power and versatility by successfully designing binders against a diverse set of twelve challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors (e.g., PD-1, CD45), multi-domain nucleases (CRISPR-Cas9, CbAgo), common allergens, and even *de novo* designed proteins. A key strength of the work is the extensive experimental validation, which goes beyond simple binding characterization. The authors show that their designed binders are functional in complex biological settings: they modulate Cas9 gene editing activity, block allergen binding to IgE in patient sera, neutralize a bacterial toxin, and successfully re-target Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) capsids for cell-specific gene delivery. With experimental success rates ranging from 10-100% (average 46.3%), BindCraft represents a significant step towards a "one design-one binder" paradigm, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating bespoke functional proteins for therapeutic, diagnostic, and biotechnological applications.

**Rating: 9/10.** This is an outstanding paper that presents a significant methodological advance with impressive and rigorous experimental validation. The success across a wide range of challenging targets, coupled with compelling functional demonstrations in therapeutically relevant contexts (especially AAV re-targeting and CRISPR modulation), marks a substantial contribution to the field of computational protein design. The high success rates significantly reduce the reliance on laborious high-throughput screening, making sophisticated binder design more accessible. The work is well-contextualized within the current literature and is transparent about its limitations, setting a clear path for future improvements.

**2. Main Ideas**

1.  **High-Success "One-Shot" Binder Design via AlphaFold2 Backpropagation:** The central concept is the BindCraft pipeline, which leverages the internal weights of AlphaFold2 to "hallucinate" novel protein binders. By optimizing a binder's sequence against a loss function that includes AF2's confidence metrics, the method concurrently generates a complementary structure and sequence for a target, achieving high experimental success rates (often finding nanomolar binders from fewer than 10-20 tested designs) and minimizing the need for large-scale experimental screening.
2.  **Generalizability Across Diverse and Difficult Protein Targets:** The paper demonstrates that BindCraft is not limited to simple or ideal protein targets. It successfully generates binders for a wide variety of therapeutically and biologically important proteins, including large, flexible cell-surface receptors (CD45), proteins with highly charged nucleic-acid-binding grooves (SpCas9, CbAgo), and even targets with no known natural binding partners or evolutionary information (*de novo* protein BBF-14).
3.  **From Binding to Function in Complex Biological Systems:** A major theme is the translation of computational designs into functional molecules with clear therapeutic and biotechnological potential. The authors move beyond just proving binding affinity and show that their designed proteins can modulate complex biological processes, such as inhibiting CRISPR-Cas9 activity in human cells, preventing IgE from patient serum from binding to an allergen, and re-targeting viral vectors for cell-specific gene delivery.
