**Paper:** Hotspot-Driven Peptide Design via Multi-Fragment Autoregressive Extension

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces PepHAR, a novel, three-stage generative model for designing peptide binders for specific protein targets. The method is motivated by the observation that not all residues in a peptide contribute equally to binding; a few "hot spot" residues are critical, while others act as a scaffold. PepHAR's process reflects this: 1) a **Founding Stage** uses an energy-based density model and Langevin sampling to identify and place a small number of hot spot residues in favorable positions and orientations relative to the target protein; 2) an **Extension Stage** autoregressively builds out the full peptide from these hot spots by predicting dihedral angles, which explicitly enforces correct backbone geometry; 3) a **Correction Stage** uses a learned objective function to refine the assembled peptide, ensuring fragment connectivity and optimizing the final structure and sequence.

The authors evaluate PepHAR on two tasks: standard *de novo* peptide design and a novel, more practical task they introduce called "scaffold generation," where known hot spots are provided and the model must link them. Across a range of metrics measuring structural accuracy, validity, binding affinity, and novelty, PepHAR demonstrates competitive or superior performance against state-of-the-art methods like RFDiffusion and PepFlow. A key strength of the method is its high rate of generating geometrically valid peptides, a direct result of its autoregressive, dihedral-angle-based extension.

**Rating: 9/10**

This is an excellent paper that makes several significant contributions to the field of computational peptide design. Its core novelty lies in the intelligent, biochemically-motivated decomposition of the design problem into hot spot identification and scaffold extension. This approach is more targeted and interpretable than methods that generate all residues simultaneously. The autoregressive extension via dihedral angles is a clever way to address the critical challenge of maintaining correct peptide geometry, a known weakness of some contemporary models. The introduction and evaluation of the "scaffold generation" task is a valuable contribution, pushing the field towards benchmarks that better reflect real-world drug design workflows. The experimental validation is thorough, with strong baselines, comprehensive metrics, and insightful ablation studies. The paper is well-written and the method is clearly explained. The only minor drawback is the inherent potential for error accumulation in the autoregressive generation process, which the authors transparently acknowledge and analyze.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Hotspot-Driven Design Strategy:** The central idea is to stratify the design process by first identifying and sampling a few critical "hot spot" residues, which are hypothesized to dominate the binding interaction. An energy-based model learns the distribution of these favorable residues. The rest of the peptide is then generated as a "scaffold" to correctly position these hot spots, breaking the problem into more manageable and biochemically-grounded steps.
2.  **Autoregressive Extension via Dihedral Angles:** To ensure the generated peptides have physically valid geometries, the model builds them out from the initial hot spots in an autoregressive manner. Instead of predicting 3D coordinates directly, it predicts the backbone dihedral angles (φ, ψ) for each new residue. This explicitly enforces covalent constraints like fixed bond lengths and the planarity of the peptide bond, resulting in a much higher percentage of valid structures compared to some competing methods.
3.  **A Multi-Stage Framework with Final Refinement:** The model uses a three-stage pipeline: **Founding** (place hot spots), **Extension** (grow fragments), and **Correction**. The final correction stage is crucial, as it takes the independently grown fragments and optimizes the full peptide structure using gradients from learned objective functions. This post-processing step ensures that the fragments connect properly and refines the overall peptide's stability and affinity, combining the strengths of generative modeling with optimization.
