Applying computational protein design to therapeutic antibody discovery - current state and perspectives

**1. Summary and Rating**

This review provides a comprehensive and timely overview of the application of computational methods, particularly machine learning, to the discovery and design of therapeutic antibodies. The authors begin by contextualizing the limitations of traditional experimental methods and the rise of computational protein design (CPD). They then create a clear ontology for the field, segmenting antibody design into distinct tasks such as binder discovery (including affinity maturation and *de novo* design), framework humanization, and developability optimization. The core of the paper is a structured review of recent computational methods, which are categorized based on their underlying approach: oracle-based models trained on experimental data, co-folding for structure-based interaction prediction, sequence-structure co-design using fragment-based or generative models, and scaffold design followed by inverse folding. The review highlights the paradigm shift from physics-based tools like Rosetta to deep learning-driven generative models such as those based on diffusion (e.g., RFDiffusion) and protein language models (e.g., ESM). A critical theme throughout is the persistent challenge of data scarcity and the gap between promising *in silico* results and robust experimental validation, which the authors identify as the primary bottleneck for the field's clinical translation.

**Rating for a PhD-level audience: 9/10**

The paper is an excellent resource for researchers in computational biology, immunology, and biopharmaceutical development. Its primary strengths are its comprehensiveness, clear structure, and timeliness. The authors successfully synthesize a rapidly evolving and complex field, providing a well-organized taxonomy of current methods that is invaluable for both newcomers and experts. The detailed tables comparing different models on their architecture, performance, and availability serve as a practical guide. The review correctly identifies and critically discusses the central challenges facing the field, namely the need for large-scale, multi-modal datasets and rigorous experimental validation, which demonstrates a deep understanding of the practical hurdles to translating these technologies. It is well-researched, up-to-date with pre-print literature, and appropriately technical for its intended audience.

**2. Main Ideas**

1.  **The Paradigm Shift from Physics-Based Design to Generative AI:** The paper's central narrative is the transition of computational antibody design from traditional, energy-function-based methods (e.g., Rosetta) to modern, data-driven approaches powered by deep learning. It highlights how breakthroughs in protein structure prediction (AlphaFold), sequence representation (large language models like ESM), and generative modeling (diffusion models like RFDiffusion and inverse folding models like ProteinMPNN) have enabled a new generation of tools that can design novel antibody structures and sequences with unprecedented speed and accuracy.

2.  **A Structured Ontology of Antibody Design Problems:** The paper provides a clear framework for understanding the multifaceted challenge of antibody engineering. It deconstructs the process into distinct computational tasks: (A) binder-focused design, which includes affinity maturation of existing binders and *de novo* design of new ones against a target; (B) framework engineering, such as humanization; and (C) developability optimization, which involves tuning biophysical properties for therapeutic viability. This categorization helps to contextualize the purpose and application of the diverse computational methods reviewed.

3.  **Data Scarcity and the Experimental Validation Gap as Critical Bottlenecks:** A recurring and critical theme is that the primary obstacle to progress in the field is not a lack of sophisticated algorithms, but a scarcity of high-quality experimental data for training and benchmarking. The authors emphasize that while there are vast amounts of sequence data, curated datasets linking sequence, structure, affinity, specificity, and developability properties are small. This data gap, combined with the fact that many published methods lack rigorous experimental validation, hinders the development of generalizable models and their adoption in real-world drug discovery pipelines.
