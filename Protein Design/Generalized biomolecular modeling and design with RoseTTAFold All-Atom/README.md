**Paper:** Generalized Biomolecular Modeling and Design with RoseTTAFold All-Atom

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper presents RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA), a deep learning model that significantly generalizes protein structure prediction to model entire biomolecular assemblies. Building on the architecture of RoseTTAFold, RFAA is the first single network capable of simultaneously predicting the structures of proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and covalent modifications. It achieves this by combining a sequence-based representation for polymers with an atom-graph representation for small molecules and other non-polymeric entities. The authors demonstrate that RFAA achieves protein structure prediction accuracy comparable to AlphaFold2 while showing excellent performance in challenging tasks like flexible backbone small molecule docking and predicting the structures of covalent modifications.

Furthermore, the paper introduces RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), a generative diffusion model fine-tuned from RFAA. This model can perform *de novo* design of protein backbones to create specific binding pockets for target small molecules. The power of this approach is demonstrated through the experimental validation of designed proteins that bind with high affinity to three distinct and challenging targets: the drug digoxigenin (10 nM affinity), the enzymatic cofactor heme, and optically active bilin molecules. This work represents a major advance, extending the revolution in protein structure prediction to the broader, more biologically relevant realm of complex biomolecular systems and demonstrating a robust, generalizable method for creating novel, functional small-molecule-binding proteins.

**Rating: 9.5/10**

This paper is a landmark achievement in computational structural biology. Its primary strength lies in successfully generalizing the powerful end-to-end learning paradigm from protein-only prediction to the much more complex and heterogeneous problem of modeling all-atom biomolecular assemblies. The methodological innovations for representing and integrating diverse chemical entities are elegant and effective. The development and, crucially, the experimental validation of the generative RFdiffusionAA model for *de novo* binder design is a breakthrough that opens up new frontiers in protein design and therapeutic development. The paper is well-written, the results are thoroughly benchmarked, and the experimental validation is exceptionally strong. It falls just short of a perfect score only because, as the authors acknowledge, the accuracy for these more complex tasks is still limited by the available training data and has not yet reached the near-experimental accuracy of AlphaFold2 on its original, more limited task of single-chain protein prediction.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Unified All-Atom Representation for Structure Prediction:** The core conceptual advance is the development of a unified framework that represents proteins and nucleic acids as sequences of residues while representing small molecules, metals, and chemical modifications as atom-bond graphs. This hybrid representation is fed into a modified RoseTTAFold architecture, allowing a single neural network to learn the principles governing the structure of complex, multi-component biological assemblies that were previously intractable for a single tool to model.

2.  ***De Novo* Design of Small-Molecule Binders via Conditioned Diffusion:** The paper introduces RFdiffusionAA, a generative model that can build a protein structure "from scratch" around a fixed small-molecule target. By fine-tuning RFAA on a denoising task, the model learns the conditional probability distribution of a protein structure given the presence of a ligand. This allows it to generate novel protein backbones with shape-complementary pockets tailored to a specific small molecule, a major leap beyond predicting or modifying existing structures.

3.  **Experimental Validation as Proof-of-Principle:** A key contribution is the rigorous experimental characterization of designed proteins. The authors successfully produced and validated binders for three very different small molecules (digoxigenin, heme, bilin), confirming high-affinity binding and desired functional properties (e.g., thermostability, specific spectral shifts). This provides powerful evidence that the computational methods are not just generating plausible decoys but are capturing the subtle physical chemistry required to create novel, functional proteins, thereby bridging the gap between computational design and real-world application.
