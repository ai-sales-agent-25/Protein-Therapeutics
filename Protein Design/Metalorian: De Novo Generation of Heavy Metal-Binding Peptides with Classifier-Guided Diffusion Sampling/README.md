METALORIAN: De Novo GENERATION OF HEAVY METAL-BINDING PEPTIDES WITH CLASSIFIER-GUIDED DIFFUSION SAMPLING

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces Metalorian, a novel computational platform for the *de novo* design of heavy metal-binding peptides, a critical need for environmental bioremediation. The framework consists of two core components: MetaLATTE, a multi-label classifier, and Metalorian, a conditional diffusion model. MetaLATTE is fine-tuned on protein language model (ESM-2) embeddings and employs a sophisticated two-stage training process involving triplet loss on augmented data. This allows it to accurately predict metal-binding specificity from sequence alone, even for underrepresented metals and subtle mutations. Metalorian then uses MetaLATTE as a guide to generate novel peptide sequences directly in the continuous latent space. It co-evolves protein embeddings and discrete metal-binding labels to produce peptides with controllable length and user-defined specificity. The authors demonstrate that the generated peptides are shorter and have lower molecular weight than natural metalloproteins while preserving key physicochemical properties. The designs are rigorously validated both computationally, through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showing stable conformations and favorable binding energetics, and experimentally. The *in vitro* validation, using a streamlined SUMO-fusion expression system and ELISA, confirms robust binding of generated peptides to copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), with one design showing affinity superior to a natural metalloprotein.

**Rating: 9.5/10**

This is an exceptional paper that represents a significant advance in computational peptide design and its application to a pressing environmental problem. The methodological innovation is high, combining state-of-the-art techniques—protein language models, classifier-guided diffusion, and co-evolving mixed-type data generation—into a cohesive and powerful pipeline. The two-stage, triplet-loss-based training of the MetaLATTE classifier is a sophisticated approach to learning fine-grained sequence-function relationships, a non-trivial challenge. The true strength of the work lies in its comprehensive, end-to-end validation. The authors do not stop at *in silico* metrics but proceed to elegantly demonstrate the real-world efficacy of their designs through robust experimental validation. This closes the loop from computational design to tangible function, a step often missing in purely machine learning-focused papers. The work establishes a strong foundational platform with clear potential for extension to other metals and design objectives.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **MetaLATTE: A Sequence-Based Classifier for Metal-Binding Specificity:** A core innovation is the development of MetaLATTE, a classifier that can accurately predict which of 14 different transition metals a peptide will bind to based only on its amino acid sequence. It overcomes the limitations of previous tools that require 3D structures. By fine-tuning ESM-2 embeddings and using a two-stage training strategy that includes a triplet loss function on synthetically mutated data, MetaLATTE learns to distinguish subtle differences that determine binding specificity. This high-accuracy classifier is the essential prerequisite that enables guided generation.

2.  **Metalorian: Classifier-Guided Diffusion for *De Novo* Peptide Design:** The paper introduces Metalorian, a conditional diffusion model that generates entirely new peptides with desired metal-binding properties. It operates in the latent space of protein embeddings learned by MetaLATTE. During generation, Metalorian is guided by the MetaLATTE classifier, which pushes the generative process towards sequences that are predicted to bind a specific target metal. This framework uniquely couples a continuous diffusion process (for the sequence embeddings) with a discrete one (for the metal labels), allowing for precise control over the function and length of the resulting peptides.

3.  **End-to-End Design and Experimental Validation:** The paper provides a powerful proof-of-concept by taking its computationally designed peptides and validating their function in the lab. The authors developed a streamlined experimental pipeline using a SUMO-fusion system for high-yield expression, followed by a custom ELISA to measure binding. This testing confirmed that Metalorian-generated peptides for copper and zinc bind their targets with high affinity, in some cases rivaling or exceeding the performance of naturally occurring metal-binding proteins. This demonstrates the real-world applicability of the computational framework.
