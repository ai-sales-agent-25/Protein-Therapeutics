**De novo antibody design with SE(3) diffusion**

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces IgDiff, a generative diffusion model for designing the three-dimensional backbone structure of antibody variable domains. The model is an extension and fine-tuning of FrameDiff, a general SE(3) protein diffusion framework, which the authors adapted to handle the paired heavy and light chains of an antibody. IgDiff was fine-tuned on a large dataset of synthetic antibody structures. The authors demonstrate that IgDiff can generate a diverse set of novel and highly designable antibody structures, whose geometric properties (e.g., dihedral angles) are consistent with those of natural antibodies. Crucially, a set of 28 designed antibodies were experimentally synthesized and all were found to express with high yield, confirming their real-world viability. The paper further showcases the model's utility in practical antibody engineering tasks—such as redesigning complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or pairing a new light chain to a fixed heavy chain—where it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art general protein design model, RFDiffusion.

**Rating: 9/10**

For a PhD-level audience, this paper represents a significant and high-quality contribution to the field of computational antibody engineering. The novelty lies not in creating a new diffusion framework from scratch, but in the intelligent adaptation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and rigorous validation of a state-of-the-art method for a critical therapeutic modality. The comprehensive evaluation pipeline, which combines *in silico* metrics (designability, novelty, diversity) with essential *in vitro* experimental validation, sets a high standard. The direct, quantitative comparison against a powerful generalist model (RFDiffusion) clearly demonstrates the value of their specialized approach and provides a strong benchmark for future work. The public release of the model weights further enhances the paper's impact, making it an immediately useful tool for the research community.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Specialization of a General Diffusion Model for Antibodies:** The core idea is to adapt a general-purpose SE(3) protein backbone diffusion model (FrameDiff) specifically for antibody design. This involved two key modifications: extending the framework to co-model the two separate polypeptide chains (heavy and light) of an antibody variable domain, and fine-tuning the model on a large dataset of antibody structures to learn the specific geometric constraints and distributions characteristic of immunoglobulins.
2.  **Comprehensive Validation from *In Silico* Metrics to *In Vitro* Expression:** The paper establishes the quality of its designs through a multi-faceted validation process. It first shows that generated structures are computationally plausible, having correct dihedral angle distributions and high designability (measured by self-consistency RMSD after inverse folding). Then, it confirms the model's utility by experimentally synthesizing 28 designs and demonstrating that all express with high yield, a critical prerequisite for any therapeutic antibody candidate.
3.  **Superior Performance on Conditional Antibody Engineering Tasks:** Beyond generating complete antibodies *de novo*, the paper demonstrates IgDiff's capability in targeted "inpainting" tasks that are common in antibody engineering. By conditioning the diffusion process on a fixed structural context, IgDiff can redesign specific regions like the CDRs or an entire light chain. In these tasks, it shows substantially improved design quality and success rates compared to the state-of-the-art general protein design model RFDiffusion, highlighting the benefits of a domain-specific model.
