| Dimension                              | Match to your Pareto-aware, developer-first peptide-design SaaS                                                                                                                              | Evidence in FORT                                                                                                                               | Gaps / white-space you still own |

| **Flow-matching DNA**                  | *Medium–high.* FORT’s “forward-only regression training” (FORT) treats normalizing-flows as a single-step **flow-matching** objective, so the mathematical core overlaps with your stack.    | Uses the same conditional-vector-field idea, but aimed at distilling a *one-step* invertible map rather than exposing an interactive frontier. |                                  |
| **Protein/peptide focus**              | *Moderate.* All experiments are on alanine di-, tri- and tetrapeptide conformations, plus a free-energy case study.                                                                          | Good proof that their flows handle short peptides, but no therapeutic context (binders, epitopes, etc.).                                       |                                  |
| **Multi-objective / Pareto surfacing** | *Low.* Single-objective physics metrics (energy, Wasserstein)—no potency/solubility/toxicity trade-offs or frontier visualisation.                                                           | Entire evaluation optimises accurate Boltzmann sampling, not competing drug-like properties.                                                   |                                  |
| **Manufacturability & safety heads**   | *None.* No predictors for SPPS yield, aggregation, hERG, immunogenicity, etc.                                                                                                                | Leaves room for your CMC & Tox modules.                                                                                                        |                                  |
| **Developer-first cloud / API**        | *None.* Paper releases research code only; no mention of latency, versioned endpoints, or compliance artifacts.                                                                              | Your SaaS wrapper, realtime Pareto explorer and SDK remain untouched.                                                                          |                                  |
| **Potential leverage for you**         | *Some.* One-step, likelihood-exact flows could speed *on-device* scoring or enable importance-sampling inside your backend; exact likelihoods might plug into manufacturability cost models. | Needs sequence→structure→property adapters to be useful for design rather than sampling.                                                       |                                  |

### Why it’s a **5**, not a 3 or a 7

* **Higher than “Preference-Guided Diffusion” (3/10)** because it actually tackles *peptides* and uses a flow-matching-inspired loss.
* **Lower than “MOG-DFM” (9/10)** because it lacks any multi-objective or drug-property optimisation, and it operates on **backbone coordinates**, not sequences or developability scores.

### How FORT could still accelerate your roadmap

1. **Exact likelihoods for risk models** – FORT’s invertible flows let you compute log p(x) cheaply; you could fuse that with manufacturing cost priors to penalise low-probability (hard-to-make) sequences.
2. **Fast sampling kernels** – their one-step maps halve inference-time versus multi-step flows; you might distil your own multi-objective flow into a FORT-style surrogate for low-latency UI demos.
3. **Free-energy introspection** – their targeted free-energy perturbation trick hints at coupling design and stability ΔG without MD; adapting it to sequence space could provide a quick “developability” axis.

**Bottom line:** FORT is a neat *algorithmic cousin*—worth mining for one-step, likelihood-aware training tricks—but it stops well short of a multi-objective, developer-grade therapeutic peptide design platform.
