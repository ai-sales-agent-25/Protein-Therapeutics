**Paper:** Disentangling the Complex Multiplexed DIA Spectra in De Novo Peptide Sequencing

### 1. Summary and Rating

**Summary**

This paper introduces DIANovo, a novel deep learning framework for de novo peptide sequencing from Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry data. The authors address the primary challenge of DIA data: the high complexity and noise resulting from the co-fragmentation of multiple co-eluting peptides. DIANovo employs a sophisticated encoder-decoder Transformer architecture that uniquely incorporates a coelution-aware pretraining step, which teaches the model to distinguish fragment ions of a target peptide from those of co-eluting peptides, treating the latter as structured information rather than random noise. The model leverages a graph-based representation of spectra, uses dilated CNNs to interpret chromatogram data, and integrates Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) and FlashAttention-2 for computational efficiency.

Experimentally, the paper demonstrates that DIANovo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods like DeepNovo-DIA and Transformer-DIA across a variety of datasets. A key contribution is the rigorous comparison between DIA and Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) for de novo sequencing. The authors find that on older instruments, DIA's advantage is limited to narrow isolation windows, but on next-generation instruments like the Orbitrap Astral, DIA consistently and substantially outperforms DDA. To explain this, they propose a theoretical framework based on XCorr p-values, arguing that Astral DIA's superior performance is driven by a massive increase in the absolute number of signal peaks, which outweighs the concurrent increase in noise peaks.

**Rating: 9/10**

The paper presents a significant advancement in de novo sequencing for DIA proteomics. Its novelty lies in the sophisticated DIANovo architecture, particularly the coelution-aware pretraining strategy that reconceptualizes how to handle the multiplexed nature of DIA spectra. The experimental work is comprehensive and rigorous, featuring strong benchmark comparisons, ablation studies, and a highly relevant, practical analysis of DIA versus DDA performance on both older and cutting-edge mass spectrometers. The inclusion of a theoretical model to explain the empirical results adds a layer of depth and understanding that is often missing in deep learning application papers. The work is impactful, providing not only a superior tool but also clear guidance and a theoretical foundation for the use of DIA in de novo proteomics.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **DIANovo: A Coelution-Aware Deep Learning Framework:** The central contribution is the DIANovo model, which is specifically designed to untangle complex DIA spectra. Unlike previous methods that treat ions from co-eluting peptides as noise, DIANovo uses a pretraining stage to explicitly learn the ion types of all co-eluting peptides. This allows the model to better differentiate between signal and noise, leading to more accurate peptide predictions. The architecture effectively combines a graph-based representation with a Transformer that uses dilated CNNs to encode temporal chromatogram information and efficient attention mechanisms (FlashAttention-2) to handle the massive data scale.

2.  **Next-Generation Instruments Unlock DIA's Potential for De Novo Sequencing:** The paper provides a critical comparison of DIA and DDA, concluding that the choice of instrument is paramount. On older mass spectrometers, DIA only outperforms DDA when using narrow isolation windows; with wider windows, performance degrades due to overwhelming noise. However, on the new Orbitrap Astral instrument, which enables narrow-window DIA with high acquisition speed, DIA consistently identifies far more peptides de novo than DDA. This finding highlights that modern hardware is key to realizing the full potential of DIA for comprehensive peptide discovery.

3.  **A Theoretical Model for Performance Based on Signal-Noise Profiles:** The authors propose a theoretical explanation for the observed performance differences between acquisition methods. Using simulations based on the XCorr scoring algorithm, they demonstrate that peptide identification confidence (represented by a p-value) is not just a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. They argue that Astral DIA, despite introducing a very high number of noise peaks, produces a disproportionately larger number of signal peaks. This substantial increase in absolute signal information is what drives its superior performance, providing a more robust basis for peptide-spectrum matching than is available in DDA or older DIA methods.
